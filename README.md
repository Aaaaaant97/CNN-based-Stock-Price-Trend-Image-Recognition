# CNN based Stock Price Trend Image Recognition

This repository is organized into the following directories, each serving a specific purpose in the development, evaluation, and interpretation of the model:

* **`baseline`**
    Contains the implementation, training, and testing scripts for the baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.

* **`Evaluation_Performance`**
    Evaluates the trained CNN models.

* **`Extension_detailed_value_pred`**
    Extension: shifts CNN algorithm from binary classification to detailed value prediction.

* **`Grad-Cam`**
    Provides visual interpretability of the model using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to explain the prediction.

* **`Sensitivity Analysis`**
    Contains code for conducting sensitivity analysis to test the robustness and stability of the model.s
